Purpose: See if there's a difference in bmi between secretors and non-secretors 


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
library(ggpubr)
library(sjPlot)

```

Import / test we have the right ones (stool data cleaning participants removed)

```{r import}

# Genotyping 
fut2 <- read.csv("/Users/yasmine.bouzid/Documents/FUT2_analysis/data/forR_fut2.csv", header = T)

# here's the thing, we should merge onto fut2 since that has the most genotype

# Gut health 

df_l <- read.csv("/Users/yasmine.bouzid/Documents/GitHub/diet_guthealth/data/df_l.csv", header = T)

# MEEEERGE 
df_l <- merge(fut2, df_l, by = "subject_id") # n = 338

table(df_l$secr_status)

# unfortunately, need to correct structure of some variables each time -->

df_l$subject_id <- as.factor(as.character(df_l$subject_id))
df_l$sex <- df_l$sex %>% recode_factor('1' = 'Male', '2' = "Female")
df_l$age_cat <- df_l$age_cat %>% recode_factor('1' = '18-33.99 years', '2' = "34-49.99 years", '3' = "50-65 years")
df_l$bmi_cat <- df_l$bmi_cat %>% recode_factor('1' = 'Normal', '2' = "Overweight", '3' = "Obese")

# READY FOR LIFT OFF
```

Age

```{r separate-test}

# Test differences in mean age between secretors and non-secretors 
# Non-parametric because...not sure whether factor levels normally distributed..guess I could test
# Anyway
kruskal.test(bmi_final ~ secr_status, data = df_l) # no difference 


# Descriptively, this tracks. Summary stats of age by secretor status--
aggregate(df_l$bmi_final, list(df_l$secr_status), FUN=summary)


# Box plot of age between secretor status
ggboxplot(df_l, x = "secr_status", y = "bmi_final", 
          color = "secr_status", palette = c("#00AFBB", "#E7B800"),
          order = c("non_secretor", "secretor"),
          ylab = "BMI", xlab = "Secretor Status")
